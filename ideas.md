# Design Brainstorm - Davi Capuzzo Website

<response>
<text>
**Design Movement**: Brutalist Sports Modernism

**Core Principles**:
- Raw, unapologetic typography with extreme weight contrasts
- Asymmetric grid systems that break conventional layouts
- Bold color blocking with high contrast
- Functional minimalism - every element serves a purpose

**Color Philosophy**: 
Monochromatic foundation (black/white/gray) with strategic bursts of neon green and electric red. The restraint amplifies impact when color appears. Represents the discipline of European football with Brazilian flair.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Diagonal split-screen compositions and overlapping content blocks. Hero sections use aggressive angles (clip-path polygons). Content flows in unexpected directions, mimicking the unpredictability of gameplay.

**Signature Elements**:
- Oversized typography that bleeds off-screen
- Diagonal dividers cutting through sections at 15-degree angles
- Video backgrounds with heavy grain/noise overlay
- Stats displayed in brutalist data cards with sharp edges

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
Instant, snappy responses. No easing curves - linear transitions only. Hover states are binary (off/on) with color inversions. Scrolling triggers parallax on diagonal elements.

**Animation**: 
Staggered entrance animations with hard cuts. Text reveals character-by-character. Images slide in from diagonal angles. No bounce, no elastic - pure mechanical precision.

**Typography System**: 
Display: Bebas Neue (all-caps, 900 weight) for headers. Body: Space Grotesk (500 weight) for readability. Monospace (JetBrains Mono) for stats/numbers. Extreme size jumps (96px to 16px).

**Design Movement**: Cinematic Neo-Noir

**Core Principles**:
- Dramatic lighting and shadow play
- Filmic aspect ratios (21:9) for hero sections
- Narrative-driven scrolling experience
- Emotional depth through visual storytelling

**Color Philosophy**: 
Deep charcoal backgrounds with warm amber accents and cool cyan highlights. Colors evoke stadium floodlights at night. Gradients transition from warm (Brazilian sunset) to cool (European twilight), representing Davi's journey.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Full-bleed cinematic frames with content in letterbox format. Horizontal scrolling galleries for career timeline. Vertical rhythm follows golden ratio. Each section is a "scene" in Davi's story.

**Signature Elements**:
- Vignette effects on images creating focus
- Glowing accent lines (like stadium lights)
- Frosted glass panels (backdrop-blur) for text overlays
- Animated grain texture across entire site

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
Smooth, cinematic transitions (ease-in-out curves). Hover states reveal hidden details with fade-ins. Scroll-triggered reveals mimic camera focus pulls. Interactions feel like directing a film.

**Animation**: 
Slow, deliberate motion (1-1.5s durations). Fade-ins with subtle scale transforms. Parallax scrolling creates depth of field. Video sections auto-play on scroll into view with crossfades.

**Typography System**: 
Display: Playfair Display (italic, 700) for emotional headlines. Body: Inter (400/600) for clarity. Accent: Oswald (300) for stats. Size scale: 72px → 48px → 18px → 14px.

**Design Movement**: Swiss Modernist Sports

**Core Principles**:
- Grid-based precision with intentional breaks
- Maximum information density without clutter
- Functional color coding for different content types
- Helvetica-inspired clarity meets athletic energy

**Color Philosophy**: 
Primary: Deep forest green (Italian heritage) and vibrant yellow (Brazilian energy) on pure white base. Secondary: Crimson red for CTAs. Colors are flat, never gradients - inspired by international football kits. Each section has a dominant color that shifts as you scroll.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Modular grid system (12 columns) with content blocks that span 4, 6, or 8 columns. Asymmetric balance - heavy left, light right. Generous margins (10% viewport width). Content "floats" in whitespace.

**Signature Elements**:
- Thick colored borders (8px) framing key sections
- Circular image crops (referencing football shape)
- Tabular data presentation for stats
- Swiss-style posters for testimonials (portrait orientation, bold type, single color background)

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
Subtle, refined interactions. Hover states add colored underlines or shift elements 2px. Clicks provide haptic-style feedback (quick scale pulse). Navigation is always visible and functional.

**Animation**: 
Minimal but purposeful. Fade-ups on scroll (0.6s, ease-out). Horizontal slide-ins for timeline events. Color transitions between sections (1s linear). No decorative motion - only functional.

**Typography System**: 
Display: Archivo Black (900) for section headers. Body: Inter (400/500) for maximum legibility. Accent: Roboto Mono (500) for numbers/stats. Strict size hierarchy: 64px → 32px → 18px → 14px. Generous line-height (1.6) for body text.
